-- NO MIGRATION NEEDED!
-- The supabase_realtime publication is set to "FOR ALL TABLES"
-- This means item_comments and comment_mentions tables are ALREADY included in realtime
-- 
-- You can verify this by running:
-- SELECT * FROM pg_publication WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
-- 
-- If it shows "puballtables = true", then all tables are automatically included
-- and realtime is already enabled for our comment tables!
